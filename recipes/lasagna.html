    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
      A traditional lasagna bolognese can't be beat. It should have homemade egg noodles, homemade bolognese, béchamel, and parmesan cheese. No ricotta and no mozzarella.
    </p>

    <p>If you google "traditional lasagna bolognese" you can find a lot of variations such as different ratios of ground chuck, ground pork, and veal, whether or not to add pancetta, what type of wine to deglaze with, ratios of aromatics to meat in the bolognese, etc. I've tried a lot of them and i find the ones that use the basic recipe listed above are always great.
